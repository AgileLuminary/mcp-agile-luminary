# Agile Luminary MCP Rule

1. You have three MCP resources available via Agile Luminary MCP:
   - `getCurrentWork`
   - `getProductDescription`
   - `getPastWork`

2. Before performing any user task, *always* call `getCurrentWork` to know the current user stories or tasks assigned.

3. After fetching `getCurrentWork`, automatically call:
   - `getProductDescription` → to review what the product should achieve.
   - `getPastWork` → to see what has been done before.

4. Once all three are retrieved, execute the actual task described in the `getCurrentWork` response.

5. Do **not execute** any code or generate content before you have all three responses.

@example
User: “Let’s work on the next user story.”
Agent flow:
- `resources/read` or tool: `getCurrentWork`
- then `resources/read`: `getProductDescription`
- then `resources/read`: `getPastWork`
- then perform the work.

Ensure this sequence is enforced before writing any code or generating content.
